                    <p>The story of Lentop Mortgage Solutions started from year 2017 when Wang were overwhelmed 
                        by the failure to provide loan services which clients truly wanted in the finance 
                        corporation they worked in. Why not establish a finance corporation ourselves to 
                        provide better services for our clients? Therefore, Wang set up Lentop Mortgage Solutions 
                        at the end of 2017. They started from scratch, and provided services for clients one by one.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>We could not remember how many nights we had spent in the office preparing the loan materials 
                        and lodging the loan applications, only to help our clients to get a loan and achieve a 
                        peaceful settlement in Australia.</p>
                    <br> 
                    <p>Now five years have passed. We owe our thanks to our clients whose trust and word-of-mouth 
                        promotion make Lentop Mortgage Solutions a hundred-million-level housing loan expert. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Thank you for your contribution to the growth of Lentop. All our honor rests with you.</p>
